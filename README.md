# RickAndMortyAPI
A React application that fetches and displays data from the Rick and Morty API. The project demonstrates the use of React Router, Axios, and Tailwind CSS to build a modern, responsive Single Page Application without any custom backend or database, fetching all data directly from the API in real time.
